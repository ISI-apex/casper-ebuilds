  <longdescription lang="en">COFFEE - A COmpiler For Fast Expression
    Evaluation. Given mathematical expressions embedded in a loop nest,
    COFFEE can be driven in the application of two classes of
    transformations: 
    * Expression rewriting, for flops minimisation. A small set of rewrite
      operators, such as expansion, factorization, and generalized code
      motion, can be composed with the aim of reducing the operation
      count.

    * Code specialisation, to maximise the impact of low level
      optimisation. For example, COFFEE can analyse the arrays, loops, and
      memory access pattern in a kernel, and then autonomously decide on
      the application of padding and data alignment, a transformation for
      enhancing the effectiveness of compiler auto-vectorisation.
