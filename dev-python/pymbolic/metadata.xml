  <longdescription lang="en">Pymbolic is a small expression tree and
    symbolic manipulation library. Two things set it apart from other
    libraries of its kind:
    * Users can easily write their own symbolic operations, simply by
    deriving from the builtin visitor classes.
    * Users can easily add their own symbolic entities to do calculations
    with.

    Pymbolic currently understands regular arithmetic expressions,
    derivatives, sparse polynomials, fractions, term substitution,
    expansion. It automatically performs constant folding, and it can
    compile its expressions into Python bytecode for fast(er) execution.

    If you are looking for a full-blown Computer Algebra System, look at
    sympy or PyGinac. If you are looking for a basic, small and extensible
    set of symbolic operations, pymbolic may well be for you.
