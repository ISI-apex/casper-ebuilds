  <longdescription lang="en">
    Htool is an implementation of hierarchical matrices (cf. this
    reference or this one), it was written to test Domain
    Decomposition Methods (DDM) applied to Boundary Element Method
    (BEM). It provides:
    * routines to build hierarchical matrix structures (cluster trees,
    block trees, low-rank matrices and block matrices),
    * parallel matrix-vector and matrix-matrix product using MPI and
    OpenMP,
    * preconditioning techniques using domain decomposition methods,
    the possibility to use Htool with any generator of coefficients
    (e.g., your own BEM library),
    * an interface with HPDDM for iterative solvers,
    * GUI and several service functions to display informations about
    matrix structures and timing.
