    TetGen is a program to generate tetrahedral meshes of any 3D
    polyhedral domains. TetGen generates exact constrained Delaunay
    tetrahedralizations, boundary conforming Delaunay meshes, and
    Voronoi partitions. The following pictures respectively illustrate
    a 3D polyhedral domain (left), a boundary conforming Delaunay
    tetrahedral mesh (middle), and its dual - a Voronoi partition
    (right).

    TetGen provides various features to generate good quality and
    adaptive tetrahedral meshes suitable for numerical methods, such
    as finite element or finite volume methods.
