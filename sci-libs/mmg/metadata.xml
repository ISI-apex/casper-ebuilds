    Mmg is an open source software for simplicial remeshing. It provides 3
    applications and 4 libraries:
        * the mmg2d application and the libmmg2d library: adaptation and
        optimization of a two-dimensional triangulation and generation of a
        triangulation from a set of points or from given boundary edges
        * the mmgs application and the libmmgs library: adaptation and
        optimization of a surface triangulation and isovalue discretization
        * the mmg3d application and the libmmg3d library: adaptation and
        optimization of a tetrahedral mesh and implicit domain meshing
        *  the libmmg library gathering the libmmg2d, libmmgs and libmmg3d
        libraries
