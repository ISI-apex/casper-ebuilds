    HPDDM is an efficient implementation of various domain
    decomposition methods (DDM) such as one- and two-level Restricted
    Additive Schwarz methods, the Finite Element Tearing and
    Interconnecting (FETI) method, and the Balancing Domain
    Decomposition (BDD) method. These methods can be enhanced with
    deflation vectors computed automatically by the framework using:

    * generalized Eigenvalue problems on the Overlap (GenEO), an
      approach first introduced in a paper by Spillane et al., or
    * local Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators, an approach first
    introduced in a paper by Nataf et al. and revisited by Conen et al

    This code has been proven to be efficient for solving various
    elliptic problems such as scalar diffusion equations, the system
    of linear elasticity, but also frequency domain problems like the
    Helmholtz equation. A comparison with modern multigrid methods can
    be found in the thesis of Jolivet.
