    BemTool is a C++ header library that only relies on the STL and Boost
    (www.boost.org/). Its main purpose is the assembly of classic boundary
    element matrices. At low level, it contains a set of elementary classes
    for low dimensional linear algebra (so as to deal with geometric
    computations) and simplicial meshes in 1D,2D and 3D. It contains basic
    wrappers for Gmsh (cf http://gmsh.info/) as regards mesh generation, and
    eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for the treatment of large matrices.

    Currently it provides routines for the assembly of boundary element
    matrices for Laplace, Helmholtz, Yukawa (purely dissipative Helmholtz)
    and Maxwell matrices in 2D and 3D. The available discretisation spaces
    are P0, continuous P1, continuous P2 and lowest order Raviart-Thomas
    elements.
