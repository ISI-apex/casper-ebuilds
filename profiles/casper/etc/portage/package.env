# Build Halide with Clang (although GCC does work too)
dev-lang/halide clang

# The prefix building script (casper-utils/jobs/gpref-profile.sh)
# bootstraps LLVM+Clang with GCC, and then switches to Clang using
# an initial package.env with the following directives, and re-emerges
# LLVM+Clang with the bootstrapped Clang; after which GCC is out of the
# picture. So, the following is only for documentation purposes,
# since the profile's package.env should be appended to the initial one.

# LLVM+Clang is bootstrapped with GCC first, and is then rebuilt with
# itself (which is required to build apps using MLIR). The prefix-building
# script (casper-utils/jobs/gpref-profile.sh) first emerges with GCC,
# then automatically edits this file to uncomment the following lines,
# and re-emerges with Clang. After the script is done, leave these
# uncommented in the package.env in etc.
