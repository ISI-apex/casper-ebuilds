# For Halide
# TODO: move clang to v11 too once released (currently need llvm:11
# because MLIR builds successfully only for v11, and a CASPER app needs
# MLIR and Halide, and can't mix different versions of transitive LLVM dep).
# Note: clang/llvm:10 needed to build llvm:11, but that's listed
# in the deps spec inside the ebuild so doesn't affect the list here.
