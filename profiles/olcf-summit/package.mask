# This is the latest version for which ghc bootstrap binaries are available
# from Gentoo, (and bootstrap using host's ghc is not desirable due to
# dependency on stuff installed into host OS, and it is not working anyway, due
# to error finding some modules, and host's ghc is also very old (7.6, allows
# building <=7.10)).
